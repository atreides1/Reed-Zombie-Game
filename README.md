# Reed Zombie Game

#### Final project for CSCI 121 (Fall 2016) created with Sierra Schlott

###### To Run:
Use `py main.py` for Windows </br>
Use `python3 main.py` for Mac

Our game is about surviving a zombie apocalypse at Reed College.
Your only hope is to craft a cure/antidote.

###### Misc Info + Hints
The game gets harder as the days go by, because zombies will spawn at an increasing rate. Different items spawn as well. </br>
Killing zombies allows you to gain experience points to eventually level up. Players can choose between increasing their health or damage. </br>
You can wait for long periods of time, but more and more zombies will spawn. </br>
You need to collect rotten flesh. </br>
There is a map which updates based on whether the player has visited a location or not. </br>
The world is randomly generated, and certain locations (i.e.) chem lab, have special actions that can be taken.
