Our game is about surviving a zombie apocalypse at Reed.
Your only hope is to craft a cure/antidote.
-------------------------------------------
But the game gets harder as the days go by, because zombies will spawn at an increasing rate. Different items spawn as well.
Killing zombies allows you to gain experience points to eventually level up. Players can choose between increasing their health or damage.
You can wait for long periods of time, but more and more zombies will spawn.
You need to collect rotten flesh.
There is a map which updates based on whether the player has visited a location or not.
The world is randomly generated, and certain locations (i.e.) chem lab, have special actions that can be taken.
